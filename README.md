### Project Fitness: Bakini Body Babes
for this project we decided to generate a website that with generate a workout and keep track of your progress. We built 4 pages and a home page. The Workout and the About Us pages will be a future project to complete. 

## HTML/CSS: Darby
I was tasked with doing the front end build of the site and the styling for it. I made the layout for the mockup and the layouts for most of the pages. Tatiana made the calander and the buttons that generate the height, weight, event, and BMI on the progress page. I built the rest of the layout for the pages.
